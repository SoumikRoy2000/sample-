  <i><p> As organised retail establishes itself all over a rapidly urbanising India, food and groceries dominate sales in these formats with some urban customers preferring to switch to these comfortable outlets when shopping for their food requirements.</p>

<p>A decade ago, shopping for fresh fruits or vegetables in any Indian town or city meant a visit to the daily vegetable market in your locality, while for grains and lentils, it was the traditional Mom & Pop store just across the street from your home. The price was competitive, but neither the vegetable market nor the grocer’s outlet would be a very comfortable or clean place.</p>

<p>In 2014, while both the formats continue to exist and thrive across the nation, customers in most medium and large cities now have an additional option while shopping for their food, including fruits and vegetables. These are the airconditioned, relatively well organised and well-stocked and clean and even if it pricier than the street, they are becoming the preferred stop for the Indian middle class which now represents a burgeoning group of people, with an increasing disposable income.</P>
here is growing awareness amongst farmers, producers, suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, and even the end-consumers, regarding the benefits of organised play. Organised F&V retail also does away with too many middlemen and hence bringing greater value and profitability to all. “In the traditional model, there can be as many as 2 to 4 intermediaries between the consumer and the farmer. The reforms under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act have enabled retailers to directly procure from farmers in many states. Corporates and chains procure fruits ex-farm for both domestic distribution and exports. For vegetables, however, sourcing is still largely dependent on wholesale mandis,” says a manager of Heritage Foods.</p>

<p>Large retail chains like Reliance Fresh, Food Bazaar, More, Easyday, Spencer’s, and Safal also have networking with farmers for direct sourcing. Additionally, they buy from local markets to maintain daily stock requirement. Says Safal’s Sahoo, “We have contacts with farmers’ association across 14 states and they supply us fruits and vegetable round the year. Our field team empowers them with information on crop planning, good agricultural practices, and most importantly, with market linkages.”</p>

<p>KPN has set up a centralised warehouse integrated with the cold chain, and a strong distribution network that is well connected to its outlets. The central warehouse also acts as a collection centre for farmers and agents. Saboro, the fresh fruit retailer, part of Indian conglomerate Mahindra Group, offers a wide range of fresh fruits, including imports.</p>

<>pBesides the evolution of the fruits and vegetables market in the physical space, this business has also evolved online, pretty much like the general e-commerce in India, which is booming as well. Several e-tailers like N-Fresh, Blive, Veg on Call, Veggie Bazaar etc. They focus on the ease of online ordering system from home and delivery to the doorstep as their unique selling propositions. Some of them also focus on organic foods or green packagings as their USPs.</p>
